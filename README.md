# ðŸŒŠ Volume Rendering

## Description

Volume rendering is a common technique used to render 3D medical imaging data such as MRIs or CT scans. This repo contains my implementation of the algorithm Three.js and React.

## Demo

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/SuboptimalEng/volume-rendering.git
cd volume-rendering
npm install
npm run dev
```

But wait, there's more! After running this command, you will be able to open the project in localhost. However, there will be no image rendered on screen! Why? I did not want to upload multiple 16MB raw files to this repo. You will need to download one of these models and upload them to the app to get started.

- Bonsai - https://klacansky.com/open-scivis-datasets/bonsai/bonsai_256x256x256_uint8.raw
- Foot Model - https://klacansky.com/open-scivis-datasets/foot/foot_256x256x256_uint8.raw

Note: The website I linked below has tons of models, but not all of them will work. I've hard-coded this project to work with `256x256x256 uint8` files that are scaled `1x1x1`.
